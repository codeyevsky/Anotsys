## üîë Key Features

- **Extensive Collection:**  
  The library contains over 300 meticulously curated patterns, organized into categories such as **Web**, **Numbers**, **Text**, and **Programming**, as well as specialized sections for **Data Validation** and **Scientific applications**.

- **Intuitive Search:**  
  A powerful search feature allows you to filter the entire library by the first letter of a word in a pattern's name, description, or category. This makes finding the perfect regex fast and efficient.

- **Instant Copying:**  
  Each pattern is presented in a clear, easy-to-read card. A single click of the "Copy" button places the entire regex directly onto your clipboard, ready to be pasted into your code.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The Regex Library is built as a **single-page application**. A central component loads a massive, categorized data file containing all the regex patterns. The user interface then dynamically renders these patterns as interactive cards. The search function processes user input to filter the list in real-time, providing immediate results. This approach ensures that the library is both **fast** and **easy to navigate**.
